# generator-simple-node

Its name is Simple Node but it's no dummy.
We realized long ago that the greatest thing we could ever create was this simple node module generator.

We captured that in a yeoman generator so we can simple run it an have babel and eslint configured and the chemical it makes your brain secrete goes into every Simple Node's simple project setup.

Come home to the impossible flavor of your own completion.
Come home to Simple Node's.
